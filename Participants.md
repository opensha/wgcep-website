This page lists the WGCEP participants for UCERF3, and is out of date.

## Executive Committee (ExCom)

The ExCom is responsible for convening experts, reviewing options, making recommendations, and orchestrating implementation of the model and supporting databases. The role of the ExCom is not to advocate specific model components, but to ensure that a minimum set of models is considered that spans the range of viability.

## Management Oversight Committee (MOC)

The MOC is in charge of resource allocation and approving project plans, budgets, and schedules. The MOC is also responsible for seeing that the models are properly reviewed and delivered.

## Scientific Review Panel (SRP)

The SRP is an independent body of experts who will decide whether the WGCEP has considered an adequate range of models, given the forecast duration of interest, and that logic-tree branch weights have been set appropriately.

## Contributors

These are individuals that contribute in a major way, either by providing expert opinion or specific model components. These individuals are likely to receive funding for their activities and are expected to document their contributions via peer-reviewed publications.
