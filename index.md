# OpenSHA is an open-source, Java-based platform for conducting Seismic Hazard Analysis (SHA)

As an object-oriented framework, OpenSHA can accomodate arbitrarily complex (e.g., physics based) earthquake rupture forecasts (ERFs), ground-motion models, and engineering-response models, which narrows the gap between cutting-edge geophysics and state-of-the-art hazard and risk evaluations.

## Getting Started

* [Learn the basics](Overview): Overview of SHA and model components
* [Try an application](Applications): Download a Java desktop application
* [Follow a tutorial](Tutorials): Follow a tutorial to learn how to use our applications
* [Get the source](Developers): Get the OpenSHA source code and contribute to the project
* [Project Goals](Goals): Learn about our near-term goals and see what types of problems we are trying to solve

## About

Like many open-source projects (see [license](License-Disclaimer)), OpenSHA is a [work in progress](Goals). Over twenty years in development, the project has been touched by [numerous](Contributors) scientists, developers, and technical experts in the fields of seismology, computer science, and earthquake engineering.

Although primarily focused on California at inception, OpenSHA is now seeing broader, national use via incorporation in the National Sesmic Hazard Mapping (NSHMP) at the USGS, and it is receiving global exposure via the GEM project.

Much of the development of OpenSHA would not have been possible without dedicated financial support of various [sponsors](Sponsors).
